### Full Command Reference

Thomas Shaffner released *Microsoft GW-BASIC User's Guide and User's Reference* to the web and you can already [find copies of it](http://www.google.com/search?q=gw-basic+user+guide) easily (try [here](http://www.xs4all.nl/~hwiegman/gw-man/), [here](http://www.antonis.de/qbebooks/gwbasman/), [here](http://200.68.11.219/utiles/utiles/Descargas/Tutotial%20GW-BASIC/GW-MAN/) or [this PDF version](http://www.divonasperi.it/divona/tam/tecnologia/dow-all/GW%20Basic%20(inglese).pdf) which fits nicely on the Kindle screen). Download a ZIP archive of GWMAN on the [archived KindlyRat GWBASIC page](http://web.archive.org/web/20160304002711/http://www.basicprogramming.org/warehouse/kindly/GWBASIC.html) or on [my downloads](Download.md).

For more command information, be sure to search the blog. As I learn things and want to teach them, you'll find them categorized under tutorials.

### RANDOMIZE, RND

- [Programming Using the GWBASIC RND Command.](http://web.archive.org/web/20160304002711/http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/438656/programming_using_the_gwbasic_rnd_command.html?cat=15)

### Portals

These portals mostly aggreate others, providing you a browsing-friendly entry point.  There aren't many of these left...

- [HERE!](https://gw-basic.com)
- [KindlyRat's GWBASIC Page](http://www.basicprogramming.org/warehouse/kindly/GWBASIC.html): Originally on Geocities until it was shut-down, KindlyRat was the place to go. In fact, the references to the [old URL](http://www.geocities.com/KindlyRat/GWBASIC.html) are scattered far and wide (as can be for an obsolete technology).

### Forums / Q&A

- [Programmer's Haven](http://codecraft.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=qbasic): Admittedly it's pretty quiet here at the bulletin board for GW-BASIC, Q-Basic, and QuickBasic.

### History

Learn where GW-BASIC fits in the annals of history as well as alongside other BASICs.

- [Microsoft BASIC Version Information](http://web.archive.org/web/20160302195326/http://www.emsps.com/oldtools/msbasv.htm).

### People (Enthusiasts)

- [Sparcie](https://sparcie.wordpress.com/): Blog about DOS, CGA, and more!

### Tutorials

Guides to learning GW-BASIC or other forms of BASIC.

- [The Secret Guide to Computers - Other Basics](http://www.secretguide.net/read/index.php?filename=other_basics):  Long-scrolling page quickly describing different versions of BASIC, including GW-BASIC and Visual Basic for DOS. As educational information it is most useful for those moving between various versions of BASIC, but for new programmers it may be of limited value.
- [Last Book of GW-Basic](http://web.archive.org/web/20160302195326/http://www.geocities.ws/joseph_sixpack/bindex.html) by the crusty and elusive Joseph Sixpack. Eccentric, entertaining, and sometimes educational.
- [BASIC Training](http://www.o-bizz.de/qbtuts/gw-train/index.htm): A GWBASIC tutorial by Steve Estvanik and converted to HTML by Thomas Antoni. This is thorough with the fundamentals of the language but only briefly touches graphics and sound.

### Program / Examples

- [Back to BASICs](http://peyre.byethost8.com/GWBASIC/): Leon's GWBASIC page; contains games and other programs. Some great stuff here with screenshots and plenty of background information.
- [Classic Basic Games](http://www.moorecad.com/classicbasic/index.html): Starts with a bit of history then moves onto the book which these games came from and finally provides a listing where you can download each one.
- [99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall](http://99-bottles-of-beer.net/language-gw-basic-743.html): 'nuff said.

Welcome Modern School of Nagpur

#### DIRECTIONS

Click, download and unzip the following zip files:

GWBASIC.EXE.zip - the complete GW-BASIC 3.23 ( 60.3K )

GWBASIC_Help.zip - a complete GW-BASIC manual by Microsoft in "help" format with indexes and easy to use format. Many thanks to Tom Cloud!

gw-man.zip - a complete GW-BASIC manual by Microsoft in html files. Thanks to Thomas Shaffner. Click on index 2 after downloading. It is an excellent linked index.

#### HINTS

GW-BASIC was once the main language used on home computers and is still useful in learning the fundamentals of computer programming and smaller utility programs. It still runs on Microsoft Windows computers thru WindowsXP, though not in a window, but on the black screen used for MS-DOS programming above that will pop up when you click on the GWBASIC icon.

GW-BASIC is an interpreted language which means that it isn't compiled. You type the program in or copy and paste it into a text ( Notepad ) file saved with the name and a .BAS suffix, surrounded by quotation marks. Entering "run" will start the program. GW-BASIC uses line numbers and runs and saves files with a ".BAS" suffix in the same file as the interpreter. You can also run a program by "dragging and dropping" the program on top of the interpreter.

You can find a Users Guide and Reference at any good garage sale or library. Also don't forget to check Amazon.com's used books and I found a "Microsoft GW-BASIC Users Guide and Reference" at Half.com for $0.75! If all else fails I have a list of GW-Basic commands for download above and several tutorials and links to tutorials.

### GWCOMMANDS

*(GWCOM.html)*

I'm constantly suprised by the number of people that are interested in GW Basic as judged by the number of hits I get. I have a GW Basic Users Guide and I'll attempt to list some of the commands. Some may not work on your computer

#### Conventions

In all attemps to tell you how to enter something, <--- will mean "hit the Enter key"

#### To Start GWBASIC

If you downloaded GWBASIC from KindlyRat, it's in a ZIP file. Use WinZip or some other compression program to unzip the file. It will then look like your computer's symbol for an ".exe" file. Clicking the icon will start GWBASIC.

#### To Stop GWBASIC

System <--- , then click the Close box (X)

YOUR MOUSE WILL NOT WORK IN THE GWBASIC WINDOW.

#### To Load a Program

Programs must be in the same folder as GWBASIC.exe.

Before opening GWBASIC:

you can drag and drop a BASIC program on the GWBASIC.exe icon. The program will load and begin running.

After opening GWBASIC:

F3 and finish the statement

load "MyProgram" <---

#### To Run a Program

F2 and finish the statement

run "MyProgram" <---

#### To Save a Program

save "MyProgram" <---

#### Arithmetic Operators

^ exponentation
- negation and */+-

#### Relational Operators

=,<>,<=,>=,<,>

#### Logical Operators

NOT,AND,OR,XOR,EQV,IMP

#### String Operators

=,<>,<,>,<=,>=

### Changing GW-BASIC files into Notepad (text) files

With old non-commercial GW-BASIC programs you can load them into the GW-BASIC program and then enter LIST. Then you can use the "Mark" feature on the DOS screen to drag and mark the whole program then save it to your clipboard. Then you paste the program into windows "Notepad" and save it as anything you want. It will come out as a text file that you can change around. For it to run like it is as a BASIC program it must be saved as a BASIC file with a BASIC subscript ( "MYFILE.BAS" ), with parenthesis around it, and saved as "All Files" which is the alternative in the "save as type" dropdown box. You can still "drag and drop" the text file on the GW-BASIC icon and it'll still run AND you can change it back to that horrible GW-BASIC format if you want.

I'd been using the above overly clever method for years when Matt Gregory wrote and said all you have to do is load the tokenized, "compressed" program into GW-BASIC and then save it in the following form: SAVE "MYPROGRAM",A . It works like a dream. I decided to keep the above paragraph to again demonstrate my lack of expertise in GW-BASIC!

### Running BASIC programs from Desktop Icons

1. Put the program you want to run in the same folder as the GWBASIC.exe file.
2. Create a shortcut to the program on your desktop.
3. Right click the shortcut ( now on your desktop ) and in the "pop up box" click "properties"
4. The "pop up box" target entry shows the address that the shortcut is pointing to. It should look something like:

```
C:\WINDOWS\MYPROGRAM.BAS
```

Change it to something like:

```
C:\WINDOWS\GWBASIC.EXE MYPROGRAM.BAS
```

5. On my computer the Icon changes to the MSDOS icon.
6. Now when you click the Icon, your GW-BASIC program will pop up and automatically run!
